		<h1 id="hi-im-bonnie">Hi, I’m Bonnie.</h1>

<p>My resume may seem eclectic. I began my career working for rural Alaskan newspapers, where my duties ranged from compiling tables of weekly salmon runs to writing and editing to laying out newspapers by hand, with scissors and a glue stick, and I’ve also worked for big educational publishers where every line in print has been perused by at least ten sets of eyes. I’m old enough to remember laboriously copying comments from editors, authors, and proofreaders onto a master set of pages, and putting a little color-coded checkmark over every fact as it was verified. (I still have very neat handwriting—a legacy of that era.) I currently do a lot of science and medical editing, including editing online digital chemistry and biology gadgets, but I also do freelance writing on topics that interest me, including writing an informal blog about spirituality and mental health. As Whitman said, “I contain multitudes.” So, yes, I’m an excellent copyeditor with a fine eye for detail, but I’m also a stirring writer, a meticulous factchecker, and I’m that colleague who tries to make the next person’s job easier.</p>
